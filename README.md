# 🌳 Responsible Stewardship™

**A GIS-Driven Arborist Tree Care & Property Management Platform**

Responsible Stewardship™ is a next-generation arborist software platform designed to transform tree care from a reactive, removal-driven service into a proactive, ecological, and long-term management practice.

## ✨ Features

- **Stewardship Dashboard** — Prioritizes "Trees Needing Care" over hazard-first thinking
- **GIS Property Map** — Interactive tree mapping with canopy visualization by DBH and health status
- **Tree Inventory** — Complete species, dimensions, age, zone, and condition tracking
- **Tree Life Timeline** — Historical care records showing improvement over time
- **Stewardship Plans** — Annual scheduled maintenance with urgency flagging
- **Environmental Impact** — Carbon sequestration, stormwater interception, energy savings, and wildlife habitat metrics
- **Condition Grading** — Color-coded health system (Healthy → Monitoring → Action Required → Critical)
